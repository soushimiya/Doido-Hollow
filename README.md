## About

Doido Hollow is a fork of DiogoTV's Doido Engine.
While the base Doido is a source code focused engine, this fork focuses on soft coding features and incorporates many improvements to the base code.

## Features

- Fully Functional Mod Folder (Most of the Basegame assets is soft-coded using this so you can use it for a template.)
- A more seamless and advanced Hscript system (can also be used for stages etc.)
- Some Cool Stuff stolen from other Engines (shhhh!!)

## Todo
- Add Script Shader supoort
- Custom Mod List menu
